# Data Structures and Algorithms Problems

This repository contains solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems from [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-problems/).  
The main goal of this project is to **improve problem-solving skills** and **strengthen core DSA concepts** through consistent practice.

## 💡 Purpose
- Personal growth and skill development in computer science fundamentals.  
- Building a strong foundation for **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**.  
- Practicing efficient coding and problem analysis in **Python** and **C++**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- and more...

## 🛠️ Languages Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **C++ 💻**

Each problem will include:
- Problem statement (reference or summary)
- Solution code (Python/C++)
- Time and space complexity (if applicable)

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Solve more **advanced problems** and explore tricky algorithms.  
- Focus on **competitive programming** practice to improve speed and efficiency.  
- Gain deeper understanding of **Data Structures & Algorithms** for real-world applications.  
- Start working on **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** projects in the future.  
- Add explanations and insights for complex problems to strengthen understanding.  
- Include unit tests for validating solutions.  
- Organize problems by category and difficulty for structured learning.
